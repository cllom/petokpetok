# Events Dashboard
Based on Tim's tutorial ([Youtube video link][yt]), which btw is a really good one. We built a kind of events board where anyone can view the dashboard without an account.

The app was deployed using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk - [My events dashboard](http://test-environment.eba-ujxq6y6a.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

- You need to create a account to add or delete items
  - Only users who created the item/event can delete it
- Adding an image to each item is optional - all images are resized to a width of 620 pixels before being saved to the database
